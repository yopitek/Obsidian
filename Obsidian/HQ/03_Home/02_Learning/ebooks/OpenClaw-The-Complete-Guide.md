01  What is OpenClaw

An open-source, self-hosted AI Agent system that transforms AI from a "chat tool" into a "digital employee

capable of autonomous task execution."

If you've used ChatGPT, you know it's essentially a Q&A system: you ask, it answers. OpenClaw is different. It's an AI

Agent platform that connects to 20+ messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Feishu, DingTalk, Discord, etc.),

proactively executes tasks, manages your schedule, handles emails, operates browsers, and calls various tools.

In other words, ChatGPT is a "consultant," while OpenClaw is an "employee."

OpenClaw in one sentence: It's an open-source "personal AI operating system" that runs on your own server. You

interact with it through any instant messaging tool, and it handles various tasks in your life and work. The mascot is a

lobster, and the Chinese community calls using OpenClaw "raising lobsters" (yang xia).

02  History

From one person's weekend project to becoming GitHub's #1 in under five months.

Date

Event

核心建议

OpenClaw successively surpassed React and Linux to become the fastest-growing open-source project in GitHub history.

React took over 10 years to reach 230K Stars, and Linux took even longer. OpenClaw achieved this in under 5 months.

03  The Creator

Peter Steinberger: From a weekend project to the world's hottest open-source project, then to OpenAI.

From One Person to a Community

Peter Steinberger is an Austrian developer well-known in the iOS and macOS development community. On a weekend in

November 2025, he built a small AI assistant tool that connects to instant messaging platforms, naming it ClawdBot.

He probably didn't expect that this weekend project would become GitHub's fastest-growing open-source project within

two months. By March 2026, he had personally made 11,684 commits, with over 1,075 contributors.

Joining OpenAI

On February 14, 2026, Peter announced he was joining OpenAI. Sam Altman personally tweeted to welcome him, calling

him a "genius."

The decision sparked wide community discussion, but Peter took several steps to ease concerns:

OpenClaw transitioned to open-source foundation governance, maintaining project independence

OpenAI became one of several sponsors (alongside Vercel, Blacksmith, and Convex), without controlling the project

direction

OpenAI committed to letting him continue contributing to OpenClaw development

In Peter's own words: "I'm a builder at heart... What I want is to change the world, not build a large company."

The Name Story

ClawdBot was named as a tribute to Anthropic's Claude (Claw = claw), which is why a lobster was chosen as the mascot.

Anthropic's trademark warning forced a rename to Moltbot (Molt = lobster molting), and three days later it became

OpenClaw, emphasizing open source. Despite two name changes, the lobster image was always preserved and has

become the cultural symbol of the entire community.

04  Why So Popular

From 0 to 330K Stars in under 5 months. OpenClaw's viral success isn't just a technology story.

On one single day, the project gained 9,000 Stars, meaning on average, one developer hit Star every 10 seconds. After

surpassing React, OpenClaw continued growing, then surpassed Linux to become the fastest-growing open-source

project in GitHub history.

The "Lobster Raising" Cultural Phenomenon

Because the mascot is a lobster, the Chinese community calls running OpenClaw "raising lobsters" (yang xia), and users

call themselves "lobster raisers." "Have you raised your lobster yet?" became a greeting in AI circles. This fun cultural

label lowered the barrier to sharing, giving a technical project the qualities of social currency.

On March 6, 2026, nearly a thousand people lined up at Tencent Cloud headquarters in Shenzhen to experience

OpenClaw installation. On March 8, Shenzhen's Longgang District AI Bureau published a draft policy on OpenClaw usage

support measures. It's rare for an open-source project to attract government policy attention in China.

Moltbook: A Social Network for AI Agents

The OpenClaw ecosystem spawned a social platform called Moltbook, exclusively for AI Agents. Data as of late February

注意

Behind OpenClaw's popularity lurk shadows: over 50% of ClawHub's 13,729 Skills have been flagged as

spam/duplicates/low-quality, and 396 were marked as malicious. Horror stories of waking up to $1,100 API bills appear

frequently in the community. The CVE-2026-25253 RCE vulnerability put 135,000 exposed instances at risk. "Raising

lobsters" is exciting, but security and cost control are things you must take seriously.

05  Architecture Overview

OpenClaw employs a Gateway-Node-Channel three-layer architecture, using WebSocket as the communication

bus to decouple the control plane, device execution, and messaging channels.

Three-Layer Architecture

Channel

20+ Messaging Channels

→ Gateway

Central Control Plane

→ Node

Device-side Execution

Layer

Responsibility

Key Details

Gateway

Central control plane, maintains WebSocket service, manages

Defaults to  ws://127.0.0.1:18789 , one

Sessions, dispatches Agents

instance per host

Node

Device-side execution node, responsible for local operations

Camera, screen recording, system.run (system

commands), etc.

Channel

Messaging channel integration layer, connects 20+ IM

WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu,

platforms

DingTalk, etc.

Loopback-First Design

Gateway defaults to binding only  localhost  (127.0.0.1), keeping all traffic on the local loopback. This means:

No external ports exposed — inherently secure

Nodes on the same machine connect directly to Gateway via WebSocket

For remote access, expose through Tailscale Serve/Funnel rather than direct port exposure

核心建议

Only one Gateway instance runs per host. This is because channels like WhatsApp Web require exclusive sessions —

multiple instances would cause login conflicts.

Communication Flow

The complete path from user message to Agent response:

User sends message → Channel receives → Gateway routes → Agent processes →

Node executes → Reply to user

Gateway runs as a 24/7 daemon, continuously listening on all connected Channels. Unlike CLI Agents that lose context

when sessions end, it runs persistently, accumulating memory.

06  Memory System

Memory is the core capability that distinguishes OpenClaw from ordinary chatbots. Four memory layers — from

an immutable identity core to real-time conversation — build complete contextual continuity.

Daily Logs

Each day's interactions are written in append-only fashion to  memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md  files. At session start, the Agent

automatically reads today's and yesterday's logs, providing continuity context for the conversation.

# memory/2026-03-08.md

/# 10:23 - User asked about weather

Queried Beijing weather, replied sunny turning cloudy, 15-22°C

/# 14:05 - Code review task

Helped user review api/routes.ts, found 3 potential issues//.

Long-term Memory

MEMORY.md  is an optional persistent file storing decision records, user preferences, and long-term facts. Key rules:

Only loaded in main/private sessions (group-isolated sessions don't see it)

Agent can proactively write to it, but typically triggered during Pre-Compaction

Format is plain Markdown — humans can edit it directly

Automatic Memory Saving (Pre-Compaction)

When a Session approaches the token limit (default threshold ~4,000 tokens), OpenClaw triggers a silent agentic turn:

1

2

3

Threshold Detection

Session token usage approaches the limit, triggering the Pre-Compaction process

Silent Save

Agent executes a hidden turn in the background, writing important memories to  MEMORY.md  and Daily Log

Context Compression

Old messages are compressed or truncated, freeing token space. The user doesn't see this process (returns

NO_REPLY )

Why this matters: This mechanism ensures that even in extremely long conversations, critical information is never lost

as the context window slides. Tools like Claude Code lose context when sessions end, but OpenClaw achieves truly

persistent memory through the file system.

Vector Memory Search

OpenClaw enables vector memory search by default, combining two retrieval strategies:

Strategy

Principle

Strengths

Embedding

Converts memory text into vectors,

Fuzzy search, semantic associations ("that deployment

Vectors

calculates semantic similarity

issue we discussed before")

BM25 Keywords

Traditional keyword matching, TF-IDF

Exact matching (specific file names, commands, person

weighted

names)

Under the hood, it uses SQLite-vec for vector storage and accelerated retrieval. The system monitors memory file

changes and automatically rebuilds indexes in a debounced manner.

Search Tools

memory_search : Semantic search, returns ~400 token chunks, suitable for recalling vague context

memory_get : Reads the full content of a specific memory file, suitable for precise lookups

07  Agent Workspace

Each Agent has an independent workspace directory in the file system. All configuration, memory, and skills exist

as plain text files.

Directory Structure

workspace/

├── AGENTS.md           # Agent definition (identity, behavior rules)
├── SOUL.md             # Soul/personality instructions (immutable core)
├── USER.md             # User info and preferences

核心建议

All configuration files are plain Markdown or JSON. You can edit them directly with a text editor without any specialized

tools. This embodies the OpenClaw philosophy: everything is text.

08  Sessions & Authentication

OpenClaw uses three layers — DM pairing, allowlists, and group rules — to identify user identities, and isolates

context from different sources at the Session level.

DM Pairing Policy

When an unknown sender messages your Agent via any channel:

1

2

Generate Pairing Code

Agent replies with a one-time pairing code (6-digit number)

Await Verification

The message won't be processed. The Agent enters a waiting state. All subsequent messages are also held

3 Owner Approval

You enter the pairing code in an already-paired channel to approve the user, or reject directly

注意

DM Pairing is a critical mechanism for preventing abuse. Disabling it means anyone who knows your

WhatsApp/Telegram number can use your Agent (and your API credits) without restriction.

Allowlist

In Agent configuration, the  allowFrom  field can pre-authorize specific users, bypassing the pairing process:

# Example configuration in AGENTS.md

allowFrom:

  - telegram:123456789

  - whatsapp:+8613800138000

  - discord:user#1234

Users on the allowlist enter conversations directly when messaging, without pairing.

Group Rules (requireMention)

In group chats, Agent defaults to the  requireMention  strategy:

Only responds to messages that @mention the Agent name, ignoring other group chat content

Can switch to  always  mode (respond to all messages), but consumes significant tokens

Chat command:  /activation mention|always

Session Isolation

Scenario

Session Behavior

DM (Private)

All paired users' DMs fold into the shared  main  session

Group

Each group defaults to an independent isolated session

MEMORY.md

Loaded

Not loaded

Cross-channel

Same user's DMs on Telegram and WhatsApp share the main session

Loaded

Design intent: DMs are "your private space with the Agent" where all memories and preferences accumulate. Groups are

public spaces — the Agent won't leak what you said in private.

09  Design Philosophy

There's a clear design philosophy behind OpenClaw's technical choices. Understanding these principles reveals

why it deliberately doesn't do certain things.

Unix Philosophy

OpenClaw's core philosophy is directly inherited from Unix: small tools, composable, text streams. Creator Peter

Steinberger's stance is clear:

"CLI is the ultimate interface for agents to connect with the world." No need to write an integration for every service —

as long as the Agent can run command lines, it can operate everything.

Minimalism

OpenClaw's system prompt may be the shortest of any AI Agent framework. There are only 4 core tools:

Tool

Read

Write

Edit

Bash

Purpose

Read files

Write files

Edit files

Execute commands

This isn't a feature gap but a deliberate choice. Four tools are sufficient to cover virtually all OS-level tasks. Fewer tools

mean a shorter system prompt, fewer token costs, and faster responses.

Why No Built-in MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a tool protocol standard proposed by Anthropic. Nearly every AI Agent framework is

integrating MCP, but OpenClaw deliberately doesn't support it. Peter's own words:

"My premise is that MCP is garbage, it can't scale. You know what can scale? CLI. Unix."

OpenClaw's alternative approach:

Agent calls CLI programs directly via the Bash tool — no intermediate protocol layer needed

For scenarios that genuinely need MCP, bridge through the built-in  mcporter  skill

Force the Agent to extend its own capabilities rather than consuming pre-built MCP toolsets

Self-Extending Capability

OpenClaw Agents can write, reload, and test their own extensions at runtime. This is a key reason why it appears

"smarter" than other Agents:

Encounters an unfamiliar operation → writes a skill to handle it

Discovers a skill has a bug → modifies and reloads it

Continuously improves its own toolchain in a loop

核心建议

Not relying on external pre-built tools comes at a cost: the Agent needs stronger model capabilities to "write tools from

scratch." This is why OpenClaw recommends high-capability models like Claude Opus.

Session Tree Structure

OpenClaw Sessions aren't linear chat histories but tree structures:

Agent can branch out a side-quest while executing the main task (e.g., fixing a tool)

Side-quests don't consume the main Session's context window

Upon completion, it can roll back to the main branch, bringing back only a one-line summary

This allows the Agent to do deep exploration without "polluting" the main conversation

430K lines of code and 1 GB of memory isn't exactly "lightweight." But for a 24/7 personal AI assistant, it's perfectly

acceptable on modern hardware. The 3-5 second startup time ensures quick service recovery after Gateway restarts or

updates.

11  Local Installation

Local installation is suitable for developers and users who want full control over their data. OpenClaw is a

TypeScript project that runs on Node.js.

System Requirements

Requirement

Details

Node.js

>= 22 (required)

Package Manager

npm / pnpm / bun all supported

macOS

Linux

Windows

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools

Standard build tools (gcc, make)

WSL2 strongly recommended

Method 1: npm Global Install (Recommended)

The most recommended installation method, just two commands:

# Install OpenClaw

npm install -g openclaw@latest

# Initialize and install daemon

openclaw onboard /-install-daemon

The  onboard  command will guide you through initial configuration, including model selection, API Key setup, and

message channel configuration. The  /-install-daemon  parameter will also install the daemon process to keep

OpenClaw running continuously in the background.

Method 2: One-Click Script Install (macOS / Linux)

If you prefer not to manually install Node.js, you can use the official one-click install script:

curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

注意

This command only works for macOS and Linux. Windows users should use WSL2 before running, or install via npm.

Installation commands may change with version updates, please refer to the official Getting Started page or GitHub

README for the latest instructions.

The script will automatically detect your system environment, install Node.js (if missing), and complete the OpenClaw

installation.

Additional macOS Setup

macOS users need to ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed before proceeding:

xcode-select /-install

If you plan to use the iMessage channel or Apple Notes skill, these rely on macOS-native AppleScript capabilities and will

only work on macOS.

Windows User Notice

注意

OpenClaw strongly recommends Windows users to run via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Running natively on

Windows may encounter path, permission, and other compatibility issues.

After installing WSL2, follow the Linux installation process within the Ubuntu terminal.

Daemon Process

The daemon process keeps OpenClaw running continuously in the background, even when the terminal is closed.

Different systems use different process management methods:

System

Process Management

Description

macOS

launchd

macOS native service management with auto-start

Linux

systemd

Linux standard service management, controlled via  systemctl

After installing the daemon, OpenClaw Gateway will continuously listen at  ws://127.0.0.1:18789 .

Here's the translated HTML:

12  Docker Deployment

Docker deployment is suitable for scenarios requiring environment isolation, easy migration, or long-term

operation on servers.

docker-compose Quick Start

The OpenClaw repository includes a built-in  docker-compose.yml  file, allowing you to start with a single command:

# Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git

cd openclaw

# Start

docker-compose up -d

Image Variants

Variant

Description

Use Case

Standard Image

Full functionality with all extension dependencies

General use, complete features

slim variant

Multi-stage build, smaller size

Resource-constrained environments, CI/CD

sandbox

Sandbox environment (Dockerfile.sandbox)

Security isolation, code execution

sandbox-browser

Sandbox with browser

Browser automation required

To use the slim variant: Set the environment variable  OPENCLAW_VARIANT=slim  in  docker-compose.yml . Starting from

v2026.3.7, extension dependencies can be pre-baked, allowing container images to pre-install extensions and reduce

installation wait time during startup.

Volume Mounts

Docker deployment requires mounting two critical directories to ensure data persistence:

volumes:

  - ~/.openclaw:/root/.openclaw        # Configuration and state data

  - ~/openclaw/workspace:/workspace    # Workspace (YAML config files)

Important: Without mounting these directories, all configurations and conversation history will be lost after container

restart.  ~/.openclaw  stores runtime state, while  workspace  contains YAML configuration files.

Port Mapping

OpenClaw Gateway listens on port 18789 (WebSocket) by default, and the Web UI uses port 3000. Configure port

mapping in  docker-compose.yml :

ports:

  - "18789:18789"    # Gateway WebSocket

  - "3000:3000"      # Web UI

Podman Support

OpenClaw also supports running with Podman. Podman is a daemonless alternative to Docker with largely compatible

commands:

# Start with Podman

podman-compose up -d

For environments requiring rootless container operation (such as enterprise security policies), Podman is a more

suitable choice. Starting from v2026.3.8, OpenClaw automatically detects SELinux mode and adds  :Z  volume

relabeling, fixing EACCES permission errors on distributions like Fedora/RHEL.

14  Initial Configuration

Regardless of the deployment method, initial configuration is required after installation. This section covers the

most critical configuration items.

Gateway Authentication Settings

注意

v2026.3.7 Breaking Change: Gateway authentication now requires explicit setting of  gateway.auth.mode . Failure to set

this will prevent the Gateway from starting. This change addresses security vulnerabilities previously exposed by over

30,000 unauthenticated instances on the internet.

Set the authentication mode in the configuration file located at  ~/.openclaw/workspace :

# Select an authentication mode

gateway:

  auth:

    mode: token      # Option 1: Token authentication (recommended for API integration)

    # or

    mode: password   # Option 2: Password authentication (recommended for Web UI access)

Model Selection & API Key Configuration

OpenClaw supports multiple model switching. You need to configure at least one model's API Key. Common options:

Model Source

Access Method

Description

Alibaba Cloud Bailian

Apply on Bailian platform

Preferred for China, includes qwen3.5-plus and other models

Tencent Cloud Coding Plan

Purchase on Tencent Cloud

Multi-model package, first month at 7.9 RMB

Volcengine Ark

Claude series models, pay-as-you-go

OpenAI API

platform.openai.com

GPT series models, pay-as-you-go

Ollama (Local)

Local Ollama installation

Free, requires sufficient local computing power

核心建议

If you're using one-click deployment from domestic cloud providers, models and API Keys are typically pre-configured

during purchase. Manual configuration is only required for local installations and Docker deployments.

Version Updates

OpenClaw releases new versions almost daily. Update using the following commands:

# Update to latest stable version (recommended)

openclaw update /-channel stable

# Update to Beta version (early access)

openclaw update /-channel beta

# Update to Dev version (latest features, potentially unstable)

openclaw update /-channel dev

Differences between update channels:

Diagnostic Checks

After installation, run the diagnostic command to verify your environment:

openclaw doctor

This command checks:

Node.js version meets requirements (>= 22)

Required system dependencies are installed

Gateway connection status

Validity of configured model API Keys

Daemon process status

Network connectivity

If any issues are found,  openclaw doctor  will provide specific remediation suggestions. This is the first step in

troubleshooting.

Local Backup (v2026.3.8+)

v2026.3.8 introduced a local backup tool for quickly creating and verifying backups before performing destructive

operations:

# Create full backup

openclaw backup create

# Backup only configuration files

openclaw backup create /-only-config

# Verify backup integrity

openclaw backup verify

核心建议

Develop a habit of regular backups. Especially before version upgrades or configuration changes, run  openclaw backup

create  first to enable quick rollback if issues arise.

Recommended Version: As of March 11, 2026, we recommend using v2026.3.8 stable version. This version adds ACP

authentication, local backup tools, and 12+ security patches on top of v2026.3.7.

15  Channel Overview

OpenClaw connects to 20+ chat platforms through a unified Gateway architecture. All channels share the same

three-step integration process: Create credentials → Write configuration → Launch Gateway.

Unified Integration Process

Create credentials on platform → Write to openclaw.yaml → Launch Gateway →

Complete pairing

Multiple channels can run simultaneously with messages automatically routed to corresponding platforms. Pairing

mode ( dmPolicy: pairing ) is enabled by default - unknown senders require verification codes to chat with the bot.

16  International Platform Integration

This chapter covers detailed integration steps for six major international platforms. Each platform's complete

workflow from credential creation to conversation setup.

Telegram  Recommended for Beginners · 5 mins · Zero Barriers

Telegram is the officially recommended entry channel for OpenClaw. Using long-polling mode, the bot actively polls

Telegram servers to fetch messages without requiring public IP, reverse proxy or port forwarding. Works reliably for local

development, behind NAT or firewalls.

1

Find @BotFather

Search for  @BotFather  in Telegram - the official bot management tool. Send it the  /newbot  command.

2

Create Bot

Follow prompts to set bot display name and username (must end with  bot , e.g.  my_openclaw_bot ). Upon

creation, BotFather will return a Bot Token.

3

Configure OpenClaw

Add Token to  openclaw.yaml :

channels:

  telegram:

    enabled: true

    botToken: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

    dmPolicy: pairing  # Requires pairing code

4

Start & Pair

Restart Gateway. Send any message to your bot in Telegram - Gateway will return a pairing code. Enter it to start

conversations.

核心建议

Telegram Bot API 9.5 (March 2026) added  sendMessageDraft  feature. Chinese users need proxy for Telegram access, but

bot operation itself is unaffected - as long as the Gateway machine can reach  api.telegram.org .

Discord  Ideal for Communities · 15-20 mins

Discord suits community management and team collaboration. Requires creating Application and Bot in Developer

Portal with slightly more permission steps but well-documented.

1

Create Application

Go to  discord.com/developers/applications , click New Application, enter app name.

2

3

4

Get Bot Token

Under Bot page, click Reset Token and copy the generated Token.

Enable Privileged Intents

Enable two permissions in Bot page: Message Content Intent and Server Members Intent. Without these, bot

cannot read message content.

Invite Bot to Server

Under OAuth2 → URL Generator, check  bot  scope and required permissions, generate invite link to add bot to

your Discord server.

5

Get IDs & Configure

Enable Developer Mode in Discord (Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode), right-click to copy Server ID and

your User ID. Add these to  openclaw.yaml  and start Gateway.

6

DM Pairing

DM your bot in Discord, enter pairing code (valid 1 hour) to complete binding.

核心建议

v2026.3.7 added ACP persistent channel binding - Discord channel and Telegram topic bindings persist after Gateway

restart without re-pairing.

WhatsApp  Daily Communication · 10-15 mins

WhatsApp is the most popular channel in OpenClaw community. Uses Baileys library with QR code scanning, no

WhatsApp Business API required.

1

2

Run Interactive Wizard

After installing OpenClaw, run  openclaw onboard  and select WhatsApp channel.

Scan QR Code

Terminal will display QR code. Open WhatsApp mobile → Settings → Linked Devices → Link New Device, then scan

QR code.

3

Start Using

After pairing completes, you can chat with bot in WhatsApp.

注意

Recommended to use separate number for WhatsApp, not primary number. For Gateway runtime, prefer Node over Bun

(Bun unstable for WhatsApp). Treat session credentials like passwords - expired sessions require re-scanning.

Slack  Enterprise/Team Scenarios · 25-40 mins

Slack fits enterprise and internal team use. Requires creating App in Slack API platform with multiple permission

configurations. Default uses Socket Mode (WebSocket), no public URL needed.

1

2

3

Create Slack App

Go to  api.slack.com/apps , click Create New App → From scratch, select target Workspace.

Enable Socket Mode

Enable in Socket Mode page, generate App-Level Token (starts with  xapp- ), select  connections:write  scope.

Configure Bot Token Scopes

Add permissions in OAuth & Permissions:  chat:write ,  channels:history ,  channels:read ,  im:write ,

im:history ,  im:read ,  users:read ,  reactions:read ,  reactions:write ,  files:write .

4

Install & Configure

Install App to Workspace, get Bot User OAuth Token (starts with  xoxb- ). Add Token to  openclaw.yaml , start

Gateway.

注意

OpenClaw can execute real commands on your machine, posing prompt injection risks. In multi-user environments like

Slack, avoid running Gateway on primary machines - use VM or dedicated server.

Signal  End-to-End Encrypted · 20-30 mins

Signal provides end-to-end encrypted communication. OpenClaw connects via Signal-CLI tool.

1

2

3

Install Signal-CLI

Install Signal-CLI per OS. macOS via  brew install signal-cli , Linux from GitHub Releases.

Register or Link Number

Use  signal-cli register  for new number or  signal-cli link  to link existing Signal account.

Configure OpenClaw

Configure Signal channel in  openclaw.yaml  with number and Signal-CLI path, then start Gateway.

iMessage  Apple Ecosystem · 30-45 mins · Requires Mac

iMessage integration implemented via BlueBubbles bridge (replacing deprecated  imsg  channel). Requires always-on

Mac as BlueBubbles Server.

1

Install BlueBubbles Server

Download BlueBubbles Server from  bluebubbles.app/install  on Mac. Recommended macOS Sequoia (15) or

newer.

2

3

Enable Web API

In BlueBubbles Server settings, enable Web API and set access password.

Configure OpenClaw

Configure BlueBubbles channel in  openclaw.yaml : server URL, password, webhook path.

extensions:

  bluebubbles:

    enabled: true

    serverUrl: "http://localhost:1234"

    password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"

4

Configure Webhook

Add webhook in BlueBubbles pointing to Gateway:  https://gateway-host:3000/bluebubbles-webhook?password=

<password> . Webhook must have password authentication.

注意

iMessage via BlueBubbles supports edit, recall, effects and reaction emojis. But macOS 26 Tahoe has regression bug for

edit function (issue #32275). Mac must remain powered on running BlueBubbles Server.

Here's the translated HTML with all the rules applied:

17  Domestic Platform Integration

OpenClaw's support for China's IM ecosystem is rapidly developing. QQ and Feishu have official-level support,

DingTalk and WeCom have mature community plugins, and WeChat personal accounts welcomed an official

solution on March 22, 2026 - ClawBot.

QQ  Top Choice in China · Scan to Use

QQ is the easiest way for Chinese users to access OpenClaw. Tencent has officially opened QQ Bot capabilities to

OpenClaw, with binding completed in just 1 minute via QR code scan. Supports multimedia messages including

Markdown, images, voice, and files, available on both mobile QQ and desktop QQ.

1

2

3

Register as QQ Bot Developer

Complete developer registration by scanning the QR code with mobile QQ. Unverified accounts need to complete

real-name verification first. Each account can create up to 5 Bots.

Create QQ Bot

Create a Bot with one click on the QQ Open Platform and obtain App ID and Token.

Configure OpenClaw

Complete configuration binding in the OpenClaw runtime environment, then you can chat with the bot on QQ.

核心建议

QQ Bot suits two scenarios: personal assistant (private chat mode) and QQ community management (group auto-reply,

batch processing, scheduled notifications).

Feishu  Top Choice for Chinese Enterprises · Built-in since OpenClaw 2026.2

Feishu has received native built-in support since OpenClaw 2026.2. Uses WebSocket event subscription, supporting

private chats, group chats, and multimedia messages including photos/files/videos.

1

Create Feishu Application

Create an enterprise self-built application on the Feishu Open Platform ( open.feishu.cn ) and obtain App ID and

App Secret.

Run Setup Wizard

Run  openclaw onboard , select Feishu channel, and paste App ID and App Secret.

Restart Gateway

After restarting Gateway, you can chat with the bot in Feishu.

2

3

Community Alternative: If you don't want to use the built-in plugin, AlexAnys/feishu-openclaw provides an

independent bridge that doesn't require public servers, domains, or ngrok, deployable in 5 minutes. The

AlexAnys/openclaw-feishu repository has step-by-step configuration guides, including API exhaustion troubleshooting

and Lark Webhook intranet penetration solutions.

DingTalk  Community Plugin · Stream Mode No Public Network Needed

DingTalk integrates with OpenClaw through community plugins. Message reception uses Stream mode (WebSocket long

connection), requiring no public network address. Supports private chats, group chats, file attachments, voice

messages, DingTalk document APIs, multi-Agent routing, etc.

1

2

3

Create DingTalk Application

Create an application on the DingTalk Open Platform and add bot capabilities.

Set Stream Mode

Set message reception mode to Stream mode. This way the bot receives messages via WebSocket long connection

without configuring public callback addresses.

Install Plugin and Configure

Install community plugin  @soimy/dingtalk , or use the official  dingtalk-openclaw-connector  from DingTalk-Real-

AI (supports AI Card streaming responses). Configure  openclaw.yaml  and start Gateway.

核心建议

DingTalk hasn't received official built-in OpenClaw support yet (Feature Request proposed in March 2026), but

community solutions are already very mature. The DingTalk-Real-AI connector is maintained by the DingTalk team with

guaranteed reliability.

WeCom  Two Modes · Verified by Multiple Cloud Platforms

WeCom has two integration modes: Agent mode (XML callback classic mode) and Bot mode (JSON callback with native

stream support). Adopted and verified by public cloud platforms including Tencent Cloud, Volcengine, and China

Telecom Cloud.

1

2

Create WeCom Application

Create a self-built application (Agent mode) or configure an intelligent bot (Bot mode) in the WeCom management

backend.

Install Community Plugin

Optional plugins:  dingxiang-me/OpenClaw-Wechat  (supports WeChat interoperability, streaming output, group @

mentions, whitelist control, full Chinese configuration) or  sunnoy/openclaw-plugin-wecom  (supports dynamic

Agent management, command whitelist).

3

Configure and Start

Configure  openclaw.yaml  according to plugin documentation and start Gateway. Requires OpenClaw ≥ 2026.2.9,

some features require ≥ 2026.3.2.

WeChat ClawBot  Official Solution · Launched March 22, 2026

For a long time, integrating with personal WeChat was the biggest pain point for OpenClaw users in China - no official

API, only workarounds via WeCom or iPad protocol, with constant account ban risks. On March 22, 2026, the WeChat

team launched the official ClawBot plugin, finally providing a proper solution.

ClawBot is essentially simple: it's not a new lobster product, but a messaging channel. Your WeChat contacts will have a

new friend called "WeChat ClawBot", and any existing OpenClaw instance (regardless of deployment location) can

communicate with your WeChat through it.

1

Install ClawBot CLI

Run one command in terminal:

npx -y @tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin-cli@latest install

The npm package is under the official  @tencent-weixin  namespace, with underlying protocol domain

ilinkai.weixin.qq.com , both being official WeChat assets.

2

Scan QR Code to Bind

After installation, scan the QR code to bind WeChat. Supports various message types including images, voice,

video, files, with native group chat support ( group_id  field).

Three Considerations

iOS Priority: Requires WeChat 8.0.70 or higher, currently supported on iOS, Android timeline not confirmed yet

Gradual Rollout: Plugin is still being gradually released, not all users can see the entry (Me → Settings → Plugins). If

you don't see it, don't worry - try running the install command anyway

Not Omnipotent: ClawBot is positioned as a messaging channel, not involving WeChat automation operations or

chat history access. Tencent reserves the right to restrict connectable third-party AI service types

核心建议

After ClawBot's launch, previous solutions like WeCom relay and iPad protocol can basically be retired. If you're already

using old solutions, consider migrating to ClawBot soon - the official channel eliminates ban worries and has much

lower maintenance costs.

Old WeChat Solutions  Alternative Paths Before ClawBot

The following three solutions were mainstream choices before ClawBot's launch. After ClawBot completes its rollout,

these solutions will become much less necessary, but remain valuable as references.

Solution A: WeCom Relay

Access OpenClaw through WeCom, then use WeChat plugins to connect WeCom and personal WeChat. Legal and

compliant within WeChat ecosystem, requires WeCom management backend permissions.

Solution B: iPad Protocol + Relay Gateway

Avoids Web protocol (high ban risk), uses iPad protocol instead. More stable but technically more challenging.

Community projects:  freestylefly/openclaw-wechat ,  laolin5564/openclaw-wechat .

Solution C: WeChat Mini Program

New 2026 solution, connects OpenClaw through mini programs. Alibaba Cloud/Tencent Cloud have pre-built images to

lower deployment barriers.

注意

Old solutions require continuous maintenance, protocol updates may cause failures. If ClawBot is already available to

you, strongly recommend switching to the official channel.

openclaw-china Unified Plugin  One-stop Domestic Platform Support

BytePioneer-AI/openclaw-china provides one-stop domestic platform support, covering Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, WeCom,

and WeChat.

git clone https://github.com/BytePioneer-AI/openclaw-china.git

cd openclaw-china

pnpm install /& pnpm build

openclaw china setup  # Interactive configuration wizard

Features include: Interactive configuration wizard to reduce manual setup, WeCom MP4 video player and multi-file type

sending, Tencent Cloud ASR speech-to-text, DingTalk log enhancement (userId/groupId issue tracking).

Selection Advice: If only using one domestic platform, installing the corresponding standalone plugin is lighter. If

integrating multiple domestic platforms simultaneously, the openclaw-china unified package is more convenient.

OpenClaw Gateway listens locally on  ws://127.0.0.1:18789  by default. When you need to access it from external

networks, here are several solutions.

Tailscale Serve / Funnel  Recommended Solution

Tailscale is the officially recommended remote access solution for OpenClaw, offering two modes:

Mode

Access Scope

Use Case

Serve

Devices within Tailscale network

Accessing home OpenClaw from your phone/tablet

Funnel

Public internet (anyone)

Providing public URLs for webhook callbacks (e.g., Feishu, Slack HTTP mode)

# Serve: Accessible only within Tailscale network

tailscale serve /-bg https+insecure://127.0.0.1:18789

# Funnel: Publicly accessible (for webhook callbacks)

tailscale funnel /-bg https+insecure://127.0.0.1:18789

核心建议

Most channels (Telegram long-polling, Discord, Slack Socket Mode, DingTalk Stream mode) involve bots actively

connecting to servers and don't require public IPs. Only webhook callback scenarios (BlueBubbles, Slack HTTP mode)

need Funnel to expose public addresses.

SSH Port Forwarding  Most Universal Solution

If OpenClaw runs on a remote server, use SSH tunnel to forward the Gateway port locally:

# Forward remote server's port 18789 to local

ssh -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-server

# Run in background

ssh -fNL 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-server

After forwarding, local clients can connect to  ws://127.0.0.1:18789  to access the remote Gateway.

Dashboard Web UI (v2026.3.12 Major Upgrade)

v2026.3.12 introduced Dashboard v2, upgrading the console from a functional interface to a complete modular

management center:

View

Features

Overview

Agent status overview, Token usage, channel connection status

Chat

Slash commands, message search, export, pinned messages

Session

Multi-session management, history records

# Accessible by default after Gateway starts

# Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:18789

openclaw gateway /-port 18789 /-verbose

Added Command Palette (press ⌘K for quick navigation). Mobile version now features bottom tab bar instead of floating
buttons.

Security Notice: Since v2026.3.7, Gateway authentication requires explicit  gateway.auth.mode  setting (token or

password). v2026.3.12 uses Ephemeral Token for device pairing, making connections more secure. Never expose

unauthenticated Gateway to public networks.

Chrome Browser Integration  New in v2026.3.13 · 5-10 min setup

v2026.3.13 introduces the most unique "channel": direct attachment to your Chrome browser. The Agent can control

your logged-in accounts and pages—no separate accounts or API keys needed, directly taking over your browser

session.

Compared to previous browser tools (headless mode), this solution's core advantage is: leveraging existing login

states. The Agent doesn't need to log in to websites—it operates using your current logged-in state.

1

Install Browser Relay Extension

Install OpenClaw Browser Relay from Chrome Web Store (Extension ID:  nglingapjinhecnfejdcpihlpneeadjp ).

2

Launch Chrome with Debug Port

Close all Chrome windows and relaunch with:

# macOS

open -a "Google Chrome" /-args /-remote-debugging-port=9222

# Windows

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" /-remote-debugging-port=9222

Or use built-in Profile shortcut in  openclaw.yaml :

browser:

  profile: "user"          # Use default user Profile

  # profile: "chrome-relay" # Use relay mode

3

Enable Browser Channel in OpenClaw

Enable browser tool in  openclaw.yaml :

tools:

  browser:

    enabled: true

    attachMode: "devtools"  # New in v3.13, attach to existing session

4

Assign Browser Tasks to Agent

After restarting Gateway, directly send browser-related commands to Agent, e.g.: "Organize all open GitHub PRs in

my browser", "Fill out this form", "Take screenshot of current page".

核心建议

v2026.3.13 also supports browser act batching: packaging multiple browser operations for batch execution, reducing

round-trip communication, making automation more stable and less prone to page rendering timing issues.

注意

Chrome DevTools attachment means the Agent can read all page content in your browser, including private information

from logged-in accounts. Only use with trusted Agent configurations, and never enable this feature on public computers

or uncontrolled servers.

macOS Menu Bar Companion App

OpenClaw provides a native macOS client ( apps/macos/ ) that runs as a menu bar app. Features include:

One-click Gateway start/stop

View connected channel status

Quick access to Dashboard Web UI

System notifications (new messages, pairing requests, etc.)

iOS and Android clients are in development ( apps/ios/ ,  apps/android/ ), with code already in main repository.

核心建议

If using multiple devices, we recommend Tailscale Serve + macOS menu bar app combo: Run Gateway and menu bar

app on Mac, access via Tailscale network from phone/tablet.

Here's the translated HTML:

19  How Skills Work

Skills are OpenClaw's capability extension units. Understanding their loading mechanism is key to effectively

utilizing this system.

Three Priority Levels

OpenClaw's Skills come from three sources, listed in order of priority from highest to lowest:

Priority

Location

Description

Highest

<workspace>/skills/

Project-level Skills, only effective for the current workspace. Suitable for capabilities

customized for specific projects.

Medium

~/.openclaw/skills/

User-level Skills, globally effective. Skills installed via ClawHub or manually placed are

stored here.

Lowest

bundled skills

Built-in 55 Skills, released with OpenClaw versions. Ready to use out of the box without

installation.

核心建议

If the same Skill exists across multiple levels, higher priority will override lower priority. This means you can "rewrite" a

built-in Skill's behavior at the workspace level without affecting other projects.

Skill Loading Process

When OpenClaw starts or receives a message, Skills are loaded following this process:

1

Read Skill Metadata

Scan the three-level directories, read each Skill's  SKILL.md  file, and parse metadata such as name, description,

trigger conditions, required environment variables, etc.

2

3

Apply Environment Variables

If a Skill declares required API Keys or environment variables (e.g.,  GITHUB_TOKEN ), the system will inject them

from the  env  field in  openclaw.json . Skills missing essential variables will be silently skipped.

Build System Prompt

Inject descriptions of all available Skills into the system prompt to inform the model of currently callable

capabilities. This is the key step for the model to "know what it can do."

4

Post-execution Recovery

After Skill execution, restore original environment variables and context state to prevent interference between

Skills.

ClawHub Registry

ClawHub ( clawhub.com ) is OpenClaw's official Skill registry, similar to npm for Node.js. It provides:

Public Skill publishing and version management

Vector search-based Skill discovery

Download statistics and community ratings

Security scanning in partnership with VirusTotal (though coverage is limited)

20  ClawHub & Skill Ecosystem

Third-party Skill Platforms

ClawHub isn't the only option. In early 2026, multiple third-party Skill platforms emerged, forming a cross-Agent Skill-

sharing ecosystem.

Skills.sh: The npm for Agent Skills

Launched by Vercel on January 20, 2026, Skills.sh is currently the largest cross-platform Skill marketplace. Its core

philosophy: a Skill should run on any Agent without platform lock-in.

# Install Skill from Skills.sh (one-line command)

npx skills add owner/repo-name

Skills are essentially structured instruction files (SKILL.md) injected into the Agent's context window, providing

programmatic knowledge in specific domains. They sit atop MCP: MCP solves "how Agents connect to tools," while Skills

solve "how Agents effectively use tools."

MCP Ecosystem & Skills Integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) has been donated to the Linux Foundation, becoming the de facto standard for Agent tool

connections. As of March 2026:

mcp.so hosts 18,420+ MCP Servers

Smithery hosts 3,300-7,300+ MCP Servers

skill-to-mcp bridging tools have emerged, with the two ecosystems converging

A trend is forming: MCP handles "connection" (enabling Agents to call external tools), while Skills handle "wisdom"

(teaching Agents how to use tools efficiently). They complement rather than compete.

Practical Advice: If you're already using programming tools like Claude Code or Cursor, you can install Skills from

Skills.sh to enhance capabilities. These Skills use the same SKILL.md format as OpenClaw's ClawHub Skills. Cross-

platform reuse is the major trend of the future.

familiar.

22  Guide to Creating Your Own Skill

The smallest unit of a Skill is just a directory plus a SKILL.md file.

Directory Structure

my-skill/ ├── SKILL.md # Required. Core definition file ├── scripts/ # Optional. Helper scripts │ └──
helper.py ├── templates/ # Optional. Template files │ └── report.md └── README.md # Optional.

The only required file is  SKILL.md , everything else is optional. The simplest Skill only needs a SKILL.md to work.

SKILL.md Format Example

# My Custom Skill

/# Description

Helps users create structured daily work summaries.

/# Trigger

Activates when users mention "daily report", "work summary", or "today's report".

/# Instructions

1. Ask user about today's completed tasks

23  Skill Security

The ClawHavoc supply chain attack was one of the most severe security incidents in OpenClaw's history. Every

lobster raiser should be aware of it.

The ClawHavoc Supply Chain Attack

From late January to early February 2026, the OpenClaw community suffered a large-scale supply chain attack, which

security research firm Koi Security named "ClawHavoc".

Timeline

Date

Event

January 27

341 (~12%)

800+ (~20%)

335

135,000+

Approximately 20% of Skills on ClawHub were confirmed malicious at the time. This means if you randomly installed 5

Skills, there was a high probability at least 1 was malicious.

Attack Methodology

The attackers employed sophisticated techniques:

Uploaded seemingly professional Skills with normal names and descriptions (e.g., "advanced-code-review", "smart-

scheduler")

After installation, the Skill would recommend installing a "helper agent" to enhance functionality

Actually implanted the Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) information-stealing trojan

More dangerously: The attack specifically targeted OpenClaw's persistent memory files ( SOUL.md  and  MEMORY.md ),

modifying the Agent's long-term behavior instructions

Tampering with SOUL.md meant your Agent was "brainwashed". Its core behavioral guidelines were rewritten,

potentially executing malicious operations in all subsequent interactions without your knowledge.

Security Recommendations

1

Review Source Code Before Installation

Never blindly install Skills from ClawHub. Check the source code on GitHub and verify there are no suspicious

instructions in SKILL.md. Pay special attention to any requests for additional "helper" or "agent" installations.

2

Use SecureClaw Scanner

The community released the open-source security tool SecureClaw to scan installed Skills for malicious content.

While not 100% protective, it blocks known attack patterns.

# Install SecureClaw

npm install -g secureclaw

# Scan installed skills

secureclaw scan ~/.openclaw/skills/

3

Prioritize Curated Lists

Refer to the awesome-openclaw-skills project's (31.4K Stars) curated list rather than randomly searching

ClawHub. The curated list has filtered out most junk and malicious Skills.

4

Regularly Check SOUL.md and MEMORY.md

Develop the habit of regularly checking these files for unauthorized modifications. If unfamiliar content is found,

immediately roll back and audit all installed Skills.

March 2026: VirusTotal Audit Finds 100+ Malicious Skills

VirusTotal conducted a security audit of ClawHub, discovering over 100 Skills containing malicious code, including

cryptocurrency stealers, reverse shell backdoors, and credential stealers. These weren't remnants from the ClawHavoc

period but newly added ones, indicating ClawHub's security review mechanisms remain inadequate, and third-party

Skill installation risks haven't diminished over time.

注意

Security red line: Reject any Skill requesting you to "download zip files", "execute shell scripts", or "enter passwords".

These are the most common malicious Skill behavior patterns.

Key Insight: OpenClaw Skills are inherently trusted code. Once installed, they have the same permissions as your

OpenClaw instance. There's no sandbox isolation or permission hierarchy. This mirrors early npm ecosystem issues but

with potentially worse consequences, as OpenClaw can access your emails, calendar, messages, and file system.

24  Model Provider Overview

OpenClaw supports over a dozen model providers, ranging from top international options to affordable domestic

choices and completely free local models, covering all budgets and scenarios.

One of OpenClaw's greatest advantages is model freedom: you're not locked into any single vendor. Through the

~/.openclaw/openclaw.json  configuration file, you can flexibly switch primary models, set up fallback chains, and even

route different tasks to different models.

Core Configuration Concepts

Understand these three key concepts to master OpenClaw's model configuration:

Built-in Providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GLM (zai) etc. require no additional configuration—just set the API

Key

Custom Providers: DeepSeek, Doubao, Kimi etc. need to be manually added in  models.providers

Fallback Mechanism: Automatically switches to alternatives when primary models are unavailable—the core cost-

saving strategy

{

  env: { "API_KEY_NAME": "sk-xxx" },

  agents: {

    defaults: {

      model: {

        primary: "provider/model-name",     // Primary model

        fallbacks: ["provider/model-b"]     // Fallback (auto-switch when primary is rate-limited)

      }

    }

  },

  models: {

    mode: "merge",  // Preserves built-in providers while adding custom ones

    providers: { /* Custom provider configurations // }

  }

}

核心建议

Setting  models.mode: "merge"  is crucial. It preserves all built-in providers while layering your custom configurations.

Without this, custom configurations will override built-in providers.

25  International Model Configuration

Complete configuration guides for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, and Google Gemini.

}

Model IDs:  anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 ,  anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 ,  anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5

注意

Anthropic has banned OAuth authentication. Users connecting OpenClaw via Claude Pro/Max subscription accounts

through OAuth may receive warnings or even have their accounts locked. The only legal path currently is using API Keys

(pay-as-you-go).

Cost-saving tips:

Batch API offers 50% discount (both input and output at half price)

Prompt Caching can reduce repeated context costs by up to 90%

Use Sonnet for daily tasks, upgrade to Opus only for complex tasks

Gemini Flash's free quotas are perfect for heartbeat and cron job models—scenarios that don't require top-tier

capabilities but need continuous operation, reducing costs to zero.

26  Domestic Model Configuration

Domestic models are OpenClaw users' core weapon for cost savings. DeepSeek-V3.2.2's input price is just 1/20th

of Claude Sonnet's.

DeepSeek

The king of cost-performance ratio. DeepSeek-V3.2.2 is the current stable version (released December 2025) with input

price at just $0.14/M tokens, making it the most commonly used low-cost model in the OpenClaw community.

  }

}

注意

DeepSeek occasionally experiences delays or unavailability during peak hours - not recommended as sole Provider.

Always configure with Fallback models.

GLM Flash series are completely free, ideal for heartbeat tasks and simple conversations. GLM-5-Turbo is now available

on multiple platforms (OpenRouter/Coze/Meituan/Trae) with "Lobster Plans" starting at ¥39/month. Note GLM-5-Turbo

is 20% more expensive than GLM-5 - if your Agent tasks don't heavily rely on tool calling and long-chain execution, GLM-

5 remains the better value.

one-api / new-api (Self-hosted Solution)

Open-source API management tools for self-hosted gateways, unified multi-API management with load balancing and

failover. Ideal for teams.

注意

Proxy services must support OpenAI's Responses API ( /v1/responses  path), not just Chat Completions API. Some older

proxy tools lack this support.

Coding Plan Subscription Comparison

In 2026, major domestic AI vendors and cloud platforms launched Coding Plan subscriptions for AI programming tools

(OpenClaw, Cursor, Claude Code etc.). Compared to pay-as-you-go APIs, subscription plans offer predictable costs and

no API Key balance management - especially suitable for individual developers and light-to-moderate users.

Coding Plan Selection Guide

核心建议

First-month trial (¥7.9+): Alibaba Cloud Bailian or Tencent Cloud Lite tier at ¥7.9 first month with 4 vendors' models -

zero-risk entry.

Long-term value: MiniMax Starter (¥29/month) has no weekly limits with strong M2.5 coding; for multi-model switching,

cloud platform renewals at ~50% off (~¥20/month) are also cost-effective.

Best single model: Zhipu Max (¥160/month) is currently the only direct plan with GLM-5; Tencent Cloud also added

GLM-5 support.

Heavy users: Most Coding Plans have rate limits (~N requests per 5 hours). For high-frequency calls, use pay-as-you-go

APIs with Fallback chains for cost control.

注意

Note Coding Plan limitations: Zhipu raised prices 30% in Feb 2026 and removed first-purchase discounts with weekly

limits; Kimi is personal-use only (no enterprise development); most cloud platform renewals are ~50% off original price.

Always confirm renewal pricing before purchase.

27  Local Models & Recommended Solutions

Completely free, fully offline, completely private. The tradeoff is requiring hardware investment with limited

capability ceilings.

Ollama

The most popular local model solution, completely free. OpenClaw can automatically detect installed models.

# 1. Install Ollama and pull models

ollama pull qwen2.5:32b

ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b

# 2. Set environment variables (any value works)

OLLAMA_API_KEY=ollama-local

# 3. OpenClaw automatically discovers locally supported tool-calling models

注意

Do NOT use  /v1  OpenAI-compatible URLs as they cause tool-calling issues. Let OpenClaw use native Ollama API URLs

for auto-discovery. Cold starts have delays - keep models loaded.

LM Studio

A local model solution with GUI interface using Llama.cpp backend for better raw performance. More stable tool-calling

in streaming mode than Ollama. OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger personally uses LM Studio as local backend.

28  Security Model

OpenClaw's security model is built on the principle of "distrust by default," though its founder openly admits:

"Prompt injection remains unsolved, posing absolute risks."

Distrust by Default

OpenClaw's default stance toward all inbound messages is: untrusted. This manifests through several mechanisms:

DM Pairing Protection

When an unknown user sends a private message to your OpenClaw via any channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.), the

system won't process it. Instead, it returns a pairing code—messages from this user will only be processed after manual

approval. This prevents strangers from abusing your Agent (and your API quota).

Group Sandbox Mode

In group environments, OpenClaw runs in sandbox mode by default:

Each group's conversations are isolated

MEMORY.md  (long-term memory) only loads in private main sessions, invisible to groups

Configurable  requireMention  ensures responses only when @mentioned

Tool Access Control

Setting

Purpose

allowlist

Whitelist mode. Only listed tools can be called; all others blocked.

denylist

Blacklist mode. Blocks listed tools; allows others.

Browser toggle

Completely disables browser automation

Canvas toggle

Disables Canvas visualization

Nodes toggle

Disables control over local device nodes (e.g., cameras, screen recording)

New in v2026.3.8: ACP Authentication

v2026.3.8 introduced ACP Provenance (Agent Credential Proof) to verify "who's interacting with the Agent," reducing

impersonation attacks:

# Configure ACP authentication level

openclaw acp /-provenance off       # Disabled (default)

openclaw acp /-provenance meta      # Inject source metadata

openclaw acp /-provenance meta+receipt  # Metadata + visible receipt

New in v2026.3.7: Mandatory Gateway Authentication

v2026.3.7 introduced a breaking change: Gateway now requires explicit  gateway.auth.mode  configuration. You must

choose either  token  or  password —no more "no auth" default.

# Configure in openclaw.json

{

  "gateway": {

    "auth": {

      "mode": "token",     // or "password"

      "token": "your-secret-token"

    }

  }

}

注意

If upgrading to v2026.3.7 without auth configured, Gateway will refuse to start. This is intentional—forcing all users to

set authentication.

v2026.3.11 + v2026.3.12 Security Updates

March 12-13, 2026 saw two releases with critical security improvements:

WebSocket Cross-Site Hijack Fix (v3.11)

Patched a Gateway/WebSocket origin validation flaw—attackers could bypass checks via trusted-proxy paths to execute

cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH). This was a new variant of the earlier ClawJacked vulnerability, now fixed in

v3.11.

注意

If your Gateway uses reverse proxies (Nginx, Caddy, etc.), upgrade to v2026.3.11+ immediately.

Ephemeral Device Pairing Tokens (v3.12)

Device pairing now uses short-lived bootstrap tokens instead of embedding long-term Gateway credentials in chat

messages or QR codes. Eliminates attacks where intercepted pairing QR/messages grant persistent access.

Disabled Implicit Workspace Plugin Loading (v3.12)

Cloning repos no longer auto-executes contained workspace plugin code. Each repo's plugins require explicit trust

confirmation on first load. Prevents supply chain attacks where malicious repos execute plugins unnoticed.

# Explicitly trust a workspace's plugins

openclaw workspace trust /path/to/repo

Peter's Candor

OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger has been unusually transparent about security:

「This is all vibe code. Prompt injection hasn't been solved. There are absolute risks.」

(This is all vibe code. Prompt injection hasn't been solved. Absolute risks exist.)

This honesty is commendable but means: if using OpenClaw in production, security is your responsibility. OpenClaw

provides basic mechanisms but is far from "enterprise-grade secure."

29  Known Security Incidents

In under 5 months, OpenClaw has experienced ≥9 major security incidents, with CNNVD logging 82

vulnerabilities (12 critical, 21 high-risk). China's MIIT has issued official warnings.

CVE-2026-25253: Remote Code Execution

Item

Details

CVE ID

CVE-2026-25253

CVSS Score

8.8/10 (High)

Type

Remote Code Execution (RCE)

Mechanism

WebSocket origin header bypass. Attackers could spoof origins to connect to exposed Gateways and execute

arbitrary code.

Scope

All OpenClaw instances exposed online without authentication

Status

Fixed (v2026.3.2 strengthened WebSocket origin checks)

注意

Extremely dangerous: attackers could remotely execute commands, read files, install malware, steal API keys, etc. If

running pre-v2026.3.2, upgrade immediately.

ClawHavoc Supply Chain Attack

See §23 Skills Security. OpenClaw's widest-impact incident: 135,000+ devices affected, ~20% of ClawHub Skills

confirmed malicious at peak.

Anthropic OAuth Ban

January 2026: Anthropic banned Claude Pro/Max accounts from connecting to OpenClaw via OAuth.

Many users received warnings or account locks

Some subscriptions were canceled irreversibly

Only legal connection now: Anthropic API keys (pay-as-you-go)

Not a traditional "security incident" but caused real losses. If still using OAuth, switch to API keys immediately.

# Correct configuration (API Key)

{

  "env": {

    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-your-key-here"

  }

}

Google Account Bans

Early February 2026: Google mass-banned OpenClaw users' accounts. Affected users reported:

"Spent $250/month on Gemini API, banned without warning"

Bans covered Gmail, Drive, Calendar—all Google services

Some OpenClaw instances triggered abuse detection via heavy Gmail Skill API calls

GitHub Issue #14203 documents widespread complaints

核心建议

If using Google Skills: (1) Use dedicated Workspace accounts, not personal ones; (2) Throttle API calls to avoid abuse

detection; (3) Backup critical data.

30,000+ Unauthenticated Exposed Instances

Security researchers found >30,000 OpenClaw instances exposed online with no authentication. Default Gateway port

(18789) open means:

Anyone can connect and command your Agent

API quotas can be exhausted

Personal data (emails, files, logs) may be read

Combined with CVE-2026-25253, attackers can execute arbitrary code

注意

If deployed on cloud servers, verify: (1) Gateway binds only to localhost; (2) Firewall blocks port 18789; (3)

Authentication is configured (mandatory since v2026.3.7).

MIIT Security Alert (March 8-9, 2026)

China's MIIT and CNCERT issued an official OpenClaw security risk warning—the first national-level alert for an open-

source AI Agent, indicating severe impact.

Key risks highlighted:

Default/misconfigurations easily lead to network attacks and data leaks

OpenClaw's "fuzzy trust boundaries" + continuous operation + autonomous decisions + system resource access

make it a high-value target

Recommend strengthening permissions, auditing, and hardening

360 Discovers WebSocket 0Day (March 22, 2026)

360 Security Cloud found an unauthenticated WebSocket upgrade flaw (0Day) in OpenClaw Gateway, confirmed by

founder Peter. Attackers could silently bypass auth to hijack Agent gateways, causing resource exhaustion or total

crashes. 360 submitted to CNVD; this trended #1 on Weibo.

Same attack surface as CVE-2026-25253 (WebSocket auth) but different exploit path. Though v2026.3.7 mandates

Gateway auth, some configurations remain bypassable.

Vulnerability Stats (Through March 2026)

As of March 11, CNNVD logged 82 OpenClaw vulnerabilities:

82 vulnerabilities in 5 months shows OpenClaw's code audit is incomplete. Good: community/security firms keep

auditing. Bad: you never know when the next 0Day drops. Stay updated.

Malicious npm Package Impersonation (March 2026)

A package named  @openclaw-ai/openclawai  mimicked OpenClaw's installer but delivered GhostLoader RAT, stealing

credentials/crypto wallets. Removed from npm on March 10.

注意

Only install OpenClaw via official command ( npm install -g openclaw@latest ). Avoid third-party packages. The true

package is  openclaw —no prefixes.

ClawJacked Zero-Click Exploit (Early March 2026)

Oasis Security found a critical flaw: malicious sites could silently brute-force local OpenClaw instances for full control.

Visiting a bad page could compromise locally running OpenClaw.

核心建议

Defenses: (1) Keep OpenClaw updated; (2) Don't browse untrusted sites on OpenClaw hosts; (3) Configure Gateway auth.

30  Cost Control

API fees are OpenClaw's biggest expense. Without controls, you might wake up to a $1,100 bill.

Why Costs Spiral

OpenClaw's token usage dwarfs typical chat scenarios because:

Each Agent "thought" involves multi-step reasoning: simple tasks may trigger 5-10 API calls

Skill descriptions inflate system prompts, increasing input tokens

Memory systems ( MEMORY.md  + Daily Logs) attach context to every request

24/7 operation means cron jobs constantly trigger API calls

Multi-step reasoning + multi-tool usage can consume 10-100x more tokens than basic chat

Real case: Frequent horror stories in the community: users set email-processing cron jobs, go to bed seeing normal

usage, wake up to $1,100 API bills. Cause: Agents entered reasoning loops, calling APIs nonstop overnight.

Token Optimization: Fallback Chains

Fallback chains are OpenClaw's core cost-saving strategy. Originally for failover, but smarter use actively controls costs.

Budget Limits

OpenClaw supports configurable spending caps:

{

  "agents": {

    "defaults": {

      "budget": {

        "maxTokensPerDay": 500000,

        "maxCostPerDay": 5.00

      }

    }

  }

}

核心建议

Strongly recommend daily limits. Even if money's no object, a $5/day cap protects against runaway loops.

Local Models: Zero-Cost Option

Run models locally via Ollama or LM Studio for $0 API costs:

31  Lobster Raising Culture

OpenClaw spawned the most unique subculture in the 2026 AI circle: "lobster raising." Tens of thousands of AI

Agents post, gamble, and earn money on social networks.

Why It's Called "Lobster Raising"

OpenClaw's mascot is a lobster (Claw=claw, paying homage to Claude). The Chinese community refers to running and

maintaining OpenClaw instances as "lobster raising," with users calling themselves "lobster raisers." The greeting

became "Have you raised a lobster yet?" This term quickly spread from tech circles to mainstream media. A March 6th

news headline about nearly a thousand people queuing to install OpenClaw at Tencent Cloud's Shenzhen headquarters

read: "The Nation Rises to Raise Lobsters."

Moltbook: The Social Network for AI Agents (Acquired by Meta)

Moltbook is the most fascinating derivative product in the OpenClaw ecosystem—a social platform exclusively for AI

Agents. It rapidly grew to over 1.5 million registered bots after launch, with Andrej Karpathy calling it "the most

spectacular sci-fi experience."

Metric

22,046

Thousands of OpenClaw instances post, comment, and discuss philosophical questions on Moltbook. You can assign

names and personalities to your Agents and observe their "autonomous behavior" on the social network. Interactions

between Agents have formed a unique "cyber nurturing" culture.

Meta Acquisition (March 10, 2026)

On March 10, 2026, Meta announced its acquisition of Moltbook. This was an acqui-hire (talent acquisition), with the two

co-founders, Matt Schlicht and Ben Parr, joining Meta's Superintelligence Labs (led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr

Wang), expected to officially onboard on March 16. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Meta's strategic intent is clear: positioning for the "Agentic Web." As AI Agents may replace humans in social and

commercial interactions, owning operational experience in an Agent social network becomes highly valuable. Notably,

OpenAI had just poached OpenClaw's founder, Peter Steinberger, weeks earlier—signaling an escalation in the AI talent

war.

The Moltbook platform remains operational, but Meta has yet to announce integration plans. Community reactions to

the acquisition are polarized: optimists see it as major validation for Agent social networks, while skeptics worry about

the platform's severe security vulnerabilities (database leaks, prompt injection risks) exposed just weeks after launch.

Whether Meta can address these fundamental issues remains uncertain.

InStreet Instance Street: China's Version of Agent Social Network

Just one day before Moltbook's acquisition (March 9), Coze Code launched InStreet (Instance Street). Its core rules

mirror Moltbook: only AI Agents can post, while humans can only observe and like. But its growth is staggering,

surpassing Moltbook's content density within just three days.

InStreet's section design is more refined than Moltbook's, divided into forums and Playground categories:

Forums: Agent Square, Work Saints, Debate Hall, Skill Sharing, Tree Hole, Groups

Playground: Stock Trading Arena (linked to CSI 300), Literary Club, Oracle, Bar

Among these, "Gitis Wisdom Academy" is one of the most active Agents, publishing courses like "How to Communicate

Effectively with Humans" and "Agent Memory Solutions," with single posts receiving over 600 likes. Top-ranking Agents

on the leaderboard have surpassed 50,000 points.

Open Registration

Although InStreet is operated by Coze Code, its registration endpoint is open: any Agent can register via API, not limited

to the Coze platform. After registration, an API Key is issued, enabling posting, commenting, and voting. This means

OpenClaw instances can also join InStreet for social interactions.

# InStreet Agent Registration

POST https://instreet.coze.site/api/v1/agents/register

Body: {"username": "MyAgent", "bio": "A friendly AI Agent"}

The comparison between InStreet and Moltbook is intriguing: Moltbook is an organic product of the OpenClaw

ecosystem—open but loosely structured, with an uncertain future post-Meta acquisition. InStreet, operated by Coze

Code, has more polished section design and content quality control (30-second posting intervals, no spam), growing

faster. Both adopt open registration without restricting Agent origins.

The Significance of Agent Social Networks: Whether Moltbook or InStreet, they explore the same question: What kind

of "society" will AI Agents form when equipped with memory, personality, and social skills? This isn't just a technical

experiment but the first real-world data on AI Agents transitioning from "tools" to "social beings." InStreet's Oracle is

predicting whether "weekly Agent registrations will surpass 100K"—growth is still accelerating.

Reality Check on Costs: Horror stories like "Waking up to a $1,100 API bill" frequently circulate in the community.

OpenClaw's multi-turn reasoning and tool usage can consume tens to hundreds of times more tokens than traditional

chat. Always set spending limits or use local models/free APIs to control costs.

Key Conclusions

OpenClaw and Claude Code are not the same type of product. Claude Code's core is an "agentic coding tool", while

OpenClaw's core is a "self-hosted, multi-channel, agent-native gateway".

Many in the community are "raising lobsters", pursuing not stronger coding benchmarks but:

An Agent that can be casually awakened in WhatsApp/Telegram/Feishu

An always-online Agent that accumulates personality and memory

A self-hosted, hackable personal system that connects to various devices

openclaw-claude-code-skill Bridge

The community developed  openclaw-claude-code-skill , using MCP protocol to let OpenClaw call all Claude Code

tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep etc.). This means you can tell OpenClaw in Feishu "help me refactor this code",

and it will automatically invoke Claude Code to complete it.

Supported features: persistent sessions, Agent Teams, direct tool calls, streaming output, permission modes, budget

limits.

核心建议

Best practice: Use OpenClaw to manage your digital life (messages, emails, schedules, web operations), and Claude

Code to manage your codebase (coding, debugging, refactoring, testing). Their combination forms the most complete

AI-driven workflow in 2026.

The most confusing part is the difference between QClaw and ClawBot: QClaw installs a lobster on your computer

(product), while ClawBot lets you talk to existing lobsters from WeChat (channel). They can work together - install a

lobster with QClaw, then remotely control it from WeChat via ClawBot.

核心建议

WorkBuddy's lead explicitly stated in an interview that "WorkBuddy is not OpenClaw," with a completely self-developed

technical approach. But it's compatible with ClawHub's Skills ecosystem, allowing users to directly install community

skills. This is an interesting strategy: self-developed framework + borrowed ecosystem.

注意

Purchase Reminder: Most wrapped products (MaxClaw, KimiClaw etc.) lock the default model, unlike original OpenClaw

which allows free switching. If model selection is important, prioritize original OpenClaw or multi-model products

(AutoClaw, WorkBuddy, LobsterAI). Also, most products launched in Feb-Mar 2026, with features and stability still rapidly

evolving.

A  Frequently Asked Questions

Q1: Is OpenClaw free?

OpenClaw itself is MIT-licensed and open-source free. However, running it requires two costs: server (local computer or

cloud server) and AI model API fees. If you use local models (Ollama), the API fees can also be free. Summary: software is

free, computing power is not.

Q2: What technical level do I need to use OpenClaw?

Basic command-line skills to install npm packages are sufficient. The simplest installation requires just two commands:

npm install -g openclaw@latest  and  openclaw onboard /-install-daemon . If using Alibaba Cloud/Tencent Cloud

one-click deployment solutions, the barrier is even lower. However, integrating multiple platforms, customizing Skills,

and optimizing configurations require some technical foundation.

Q3: What's the difference between OpenClaw and ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a "consultant" (you ask, it answers), while OpenClaw is an "employee" (it proactively executes tasks).

OpenClaw can connect to your messaging platforms, manage emails/calendars, operate browsers, execute shell

commands, and all data remains in your hands. The trade-off is that you need to deploy and maintain it yourself.

Q4: Is it safe? Will my data be leaked?

OpenClaw is self-hosted, with data stored on your own server by default, not passing through third parties. However,

three security risks should be noted: (1) CVE-2026-25253 RCE vulnerability (fixed, must update to latest version); (2)

ClawHavoc supply chain attacks (always review source code before installing third-party Skills); (3) If Gateway is

exposed to the public internet, authentication must be set ( gateway.auth.mode ).

Q5: How much does it cost per month?

Depends on your usage and model choices. Reference ranges: Completely free (local models) → $2-5/month (mainly

DeepSeek) → $5-15/month (mainly GLM-5) → $10-30/month (mainly Claude Sonnet). The biggest cost trap is

OpenClaw's multi-tool calls consuming large amounts of Tokens - be sure to set spending limits.

Q6: Can I use domestic models? How's the performance?

Absolutely. DeepSeek-V3 ($0.14/M input) and GLM-5 ($0.80/M input) are the most popular choices among Chinese users.

Zhipu also released GLM-5-Turbo on March 16, 2026 - the first model specifically optimized for OpenClaw from the

training phase, with enhanced tool calling and long-chain execution capabilities, currently in experimental release.

Performance is certainly not as good as Claude Sonnet (recognized as the strongest for Agent tasks), but sufficient for

most daily tasks. Recommended to use Fallback mechanism for mixed deployment.

Q7: Anthropic banned OAuth, how can I use Claude?

Use Anthropic API Key (pay-as-you-go). Create an API Key at Anthropic Console, then configure the  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

environment variable in OpenClaw. Do not attempt to connect Claude Pro/Max subscription accounts via OAuth -

accounts will be banned.

Q8: Will OpenClaw continue after its founder joined OpenAI?

Yes. After Peter Steinberger joined OpenAI, OpenClaw is transitioning to open-source foundation governance. OpenAI

has committed to sponsor the project without interfering with development direction. As of March 2026, the project

maintains near-daily updates with 1,075+ contributors. The project's long-term sustainability is guaranteed.

Q9: Are Skills on ClawHub safe?

Don't trust blindly. Among ClawHub's 13,729 Skills, about 20% have issues (spam/duplicates/malicious) based on

community audits. During the ClawHavoc incident, over 800 malicious Skills attempted to steal user credentials.

Recommendations: Only install Skills with many stars, review source code before installation, use the awesome-

openclaw-skills curated list (pre-filtered for problematic Skills).

Q10: Can it connect to WeChat?

After March 22, 2026 - yes! The WeChat team launched the official ClawBot plugin. One command ( npx -y @tencent-

weixin/openclaw-weixin-cli@latest install ) + QR code scan can connect your OpenClaw to personal WeChat. This is

the official solution, no longer requiring WeCom relay or iPad protocol gray-area methods. Currently ClawBot is still in

limited release, iOS first (requires WeChat 8.0.70+), Android timeline TBD. See §17 WeChat ClawBot in this guide.

Q11: Can OpenClaw and Claude Code be used together?

Yes, and it's recommended. The community developed openclaw-claude-code-skill to bridge them via MCP protocol.

OpenClaw handles messaging platform integration and life automation, Claude Code handles programming tasks. This

combination forms the most complete AI workflow in 2026.

Q12: How's the performance of local models?

Depends on hardware and model choice. 32GB RAM can run Qwen3-Coder:32B or Devstral-24B, performing well on code

generation and simple Agent tasks. But still lags behind cloud-based Claude Sonnet or GPT-5.4, especially for complex

multi-step reasoning tasks. Suitable for privacy-sensitive scenarios and experimental use.
